# Shiny app for "Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during mouse early organogenesis"

This repository contains the code for the R shiny app for the Dnmt1<sup>-/-</sup>, Dnmt3a<sup>-/-</sup> and Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup> KO analysis of our study [Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during early mouse organogenesis](XXX). It covers most of Figures 1-2 as well as Supplementary Figures 1-4.
The source code for the second part of the paper, where we explore the *Tet*-TKO embryos, is available in [this repository](https://github.com/rargelaguet/10x_gastrulation_TetChimera)
